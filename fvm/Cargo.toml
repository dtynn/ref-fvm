## These are the built-in actors that we ship with the FVM in Milestone 0.
## Starting with Milestone 1, the bytecode will no longer be inlined within the
## FVM library. Instead, it will be stored in the blockstore managed by the node.
##
## How does the WASM bytecode inlining work?
##
## Each crate has a build script that uses wasm-builder to produce the WASM
## bytecode. Cargo runs build scripts _before_ the ordinary build. The ordinary
## build then embeds the WASM output into a constant in the library. The fvm
## crate then imports those constants.
##
## Why are they optional?
##
## In order to speed up development builds, these dependencies are only activated
## when the `builtin_actors` feature is enabled.
