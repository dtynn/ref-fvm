// Design:
//
// The goal of this library is to expose go-based blockstores over a C-FFI as efficiently as
// possible (without too many hacks). Importantly, this means avoiding locks in the happy path.
//
// To do this, we make liberal use of unsafe pointers and atomic operations such that looking up a
// blockstore requires exactly one atomic read. This means that this API can be _very_ dangerous if
// used incorrectly.
//
// NOTE: This is totally a premature optimization and we may need to ditch all of it. I got a bit
// carried away.
